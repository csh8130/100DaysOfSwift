##### Rules

If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!

I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn.
